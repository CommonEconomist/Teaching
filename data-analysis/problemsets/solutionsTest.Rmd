# Code for problem sets and computer test

## Problem set 1
```
#### Question 1 (1) #### 
# Use a boxplot to visualise the distribution of the export data. 
# What are the average and median level of coffee exports? 
boxplot(coffee$export)
mean(coffee$export)   # Mean=207.5
median(coffee$export) # Median=12

#### Question 2 (2) ####
# Which are the top three coffee exporters, and what is their 
# share of world trade?
# NB - to order the data frame you create you can use NAME[order(-NAME$VAR),]
# Where NAME is the name you give the data frame and VAR the name of 
# your variable.
coffee_pc<-aggregate(export~country,coffee,sum)
coffee_pc$share=coffee_pc$export/sum(coffee_pc$export)
coffee_pc<-coffee_pc[order(-coffee_pc$export),]
# The three largest exporters are 1) Brazil, 2) Vietnam, and 3) Colombia and 
# the control 27, 21, and 10 procent of world trade respectively. 

#### Question 3 (2) #### 
# Plot the distribution of coffee exports per region, analyse your results
# with regard to the variability in the data. Adjust the data to exclude 
# 0 exports and plot the data again. Are there any noticable changes?
par(mar=c(4,10,1,1))
boxplot(coffee$export~coffee$region,horizontal=TRUE)
boxplot(coffee[coffee$export>0,]$export~coffee[coffee$export>0,]$region,
        horizontal=TRUE)
# In general there is a lot of variability with some large exporters and a lot
# of countries that produce and export some coffee. 
# The data contains coffee producing countries that haven't exported during 
# the given time period but excluding these doesn't change the pattern in the 
# data

#### Question 4 (1) ####
# Arabica coffee is the most traded coffee in the world. The plant that
# produces the beans is indigenous to the highlands of Ethiopia. 
# What is the Ethiopian share in the global coffee trade?
# Plot their exports over time.
coffee_pc[coffee_pc$country=="Ethiopia",]$share # 3%
plot(coffee[coffee$country=="Ethiopia",]$export,type="b",ylab="",xlab="")


#### Question 5 (1) #### 
# What was the total revenue, in million dollars, of Ethiopian exports?
arabica.p<-c(154.20,155.40,165.85,172.35,170.34,178.07) # Price vector
eth.x<-coffee[coffee$country=="Ethiopia",]$export       # Export vector

# The price is in cents per pound, but the data is in 1000s 60 kg bags,
# so we need to convert this:
eth.x<-eth.x*1000*60*2.2    # In pounds
eth.rev=eth.x*arabica.p/100 # In Dollars
sum(eth.rev)/1000000        # 403 million dollars total revenue

#### Question 6 (1) ####
# Vietnam is a large coffee exporter and the world's main exporter of 
# Robusta coffee which was introduced there by the French. 
# In which month did Vietnam have the largest revenue?
robusta.p<-c(87.60,91.03,92.61,96.98,96.68,101.77)     # Price vector
vnm.x<-coffee[coffee$country=="Vietnam",]$export       # Export vector
vnm.x<-vnm.x*1000*60*2.2            # In pounds
vnm.rev=vnm.x*robusta.p/100/1000000 # In Million Dollars
plot(vnm.rev,type="b",xlab="",ylab="")

#### Question 7 (2) ####
# Brazil is the largest coffee producer in the world. 
# Their production consists for 70% of Arabica and the remaining 30% of Robusta. 
# Calculate the price index, in million dollars, for Brazil.
# In how many months were exports above average? 
# And in how many months were revenues above average?
bra.x<-coffee[coffee$country=="Brazil",]$export       # Export vector
bra.x<-bra.x*1000*60*2.2    # In pounds
bra.rev=(bra.x*.3*robusta.p+bra.x*.7*arabica.p)/100/1000000

plot(bra.x,type="b");abline(h=mean(bra.x),lty=2)
plot(bra.rev,type="b");abline(h=mean(bra.rev),lty=2)

# Exports were above avera in three months (May, August, September), while
# revenues were only above average in two months (August, September) due to 
# price differences.

## Problem set 2
```
#### Question 1 (1) ####
# Find the the average value of the share of primary products exports (SXP) and 
# compare the GDP growth rate (GEA7090) for countries with above average
# values for the share of primary products exports with the average GDP growth 
# rate. 
# Which conclusion would you make here?
mean(sw$SXP)
mean(sw$GEA7090)
mean(sw[sw$SXP>mean(sw$SXP),]$GEA7090)

#### Question 2 (2) #### 
# As the paper's title suggests, Sachs & Warner examined the link between
# abudance in natural resources and economic growth. 
# Use the data to find the correlation between economic growth and natural 
# resources and analyse it. 
# Let's assume that the relation between the two can be described as:
# GEA7090=a+b*SXP. What would be the expected average GDP growth rate when the
# share of primary products exports is 0, and what if it was 1? 
cor(sw$GEA7090,sw$SXP)
b=cov(sw$GEA7090,sw$SXP)/var(sw$SXP)
a=mean(sw$GEA7090)-b*mean(sw$SXP)
a+b*0
a+b*1

#### Question 3 (3) ####
# Plot the share of primary products (SXP) versus the average GDP growth rate 
# and add a regression line to the plot. 
# (NB - You can do this using 'abline(MODEL)')
# Do you suspect there are outliers in the data?
# If so which, if not explain why.
plot(sw$SXP,sw$GEA7090,
     xlab="Primary products exports/GNP",ylab="Average annual GDP growth rate")

m1<-lm(GEA7090~SXP,sw)
abline(m1)

abline(v=.29)
sw_out<-sw[sw$SXP>=.29,]

#### Question 4 (3) ####
# Fit a regression model to the data estimating the effect of 
# primary products exports on the GDP growth rate, accounting for initial
# GDP level.
# What is the estimated effect of resource abundance on GDP growth?
# Inspect the fit of the model by plotting the observed versus the fitted
# values and the residuals versus the fitted values. 
# Analyse your results.
m2<-lm(GEA7090~SXP+LGDPEA70,sw)
summary(m2)

yhat<-fitted(m2) 
u<-m2$residuals  

par(mfrow=c(1,2),pty="s",las=1) # 'pty="s"' makes a square plot
plot(sw$GEA7090,yhat) 
plot(u,yhat) 

#### Question 5 (1) ####
# Repeat question 4 but not also accounting for the level of openess of the 
# economy. How does this model compare to the previous model?
m3<-lm(GEA7090~SXP+LGDPEA70+SOPEN,sw)

## Computer test
```
#### Question 1 (1) ####
# Which type of probability distribution do you think would best fit the food
# supply data? 
hist(x$food_sup_total)

#### Question 2 (1) ####
# Plot the time-series for food supply levels for Indonesia and briefly
# discuss the data. 
idn<-ts(x[x$country=="Indonesia",]$food_sup_total,start=c(1962,1),freq=1)
plot(idn)

#### Question 3 (2) ####
# To examine the trend in food supply levels over time, use the boxplot to
# visualise the distribution of food supply levels for each year and discuss
# whether you notice any trends or patterns in the data. 
boxplot(food_sup_total~year,x)

#### Question 4 (3) ####
# How would you describe the relation between income levels and food supply and 
# regime type and food supply?
plot(x$gdpcap,x$food_sup_total,log="x")
boxplot(food_sup_total~regime,x,horizontal=TRUE)

#### Question 5 (2) #### 
# You're asked to estimate the effect of regime type and income on food 
# supply levels. 
# Unfortunately, due to a change in methodology related to measuring the food
# supply levels you can only use data from 1991 onwards. 
# Additionally, you have to rescale the GDP data to be measured in 1000s. 
# Estimate the regression models and discuss the estimated coefficients as well
# as the fit of the model. 
x<-x[x$year>1990,]
x$income=x$gdpcap/1000

#### Questions 6 (1) ####
# Re-estimate your model from question 5 but now include the lagged outcome
# variable. 
# How does this alter the results?
